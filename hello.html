<h1>My Love for Coding</h1>
<p>I have loved coding for so many years but I didn't know where to start from.</p>
<p>I tried learning on my own without anyone's guidance, but that also failed. Then I took a break.</p>
<P>Hubby knew the passion I had. One day he met a client who happened to be a programmer. He took her contacts and hooked me up with her. Thanks to hubby's efforts, I am at it again.</P>
<h3>What keeps me going</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The zeal I have for tech.</li>
  <li>Determination to find a job.</li>
  <li>Encouragement from hubby.</li>
